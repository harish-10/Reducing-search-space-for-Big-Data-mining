# Reducing-search-space-for-Big-Data-mining
The aim of the project is to mine Frequent Patterns from Uncertain Big Data and reduce the search space. 
By making use of Map Reduce and using user Defined Constraints. 


This will significantly reduce the Cost and Time of Processing Uncertain Data. T
echnical paper titled “Uncertain Big Data Strategical Miner” has been accepted for publication in “International Journal of Computer Sciences and Engineering (IJCSE)” Volume-05, Issue-6 in June 2017.
